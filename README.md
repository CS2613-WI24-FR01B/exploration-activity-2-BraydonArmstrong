# 1. Which Package/library does the sample program demonstrate?

P5JS

# 2. How does someone run your program?

You must install a VSCode extension known as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

Then open Monsters.js and click the Go Live button in the bottom right\
![Go live button](<Markdown Images/image.png>)

Once run you can start the game as it will open in a browser being hosted locally on your machine

If you cannot get it running there you can go to my [Github Page](https://braydonarmstrong.github.io)

This page also supports mobile browsers, although the controls are a little annooying to use on Apple devices as holding the movement buttons causes a selection to appear, on Android it runs quite well.

# 3. What purpose does your program serve?

Entertain people for a while and bring some joy.

# 4. What would be some sample input/output?
